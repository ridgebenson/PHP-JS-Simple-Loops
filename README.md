# Simple Loops in JS and PHP

The repo shows the basic functionality of the *do*, *while*, and *for* loops in JavaScript and PHP. JavaScript code is written in the .html files whereas PHP code is written in the .php files.

## Why Loops?

Loops are fundamental constructs in any programming language, allowing for repetitive execution of code blocks. They are essential for tasks that require the same operation to be performed on a series of data or for creating iterative processes that continue until a certain condition is met.

## What's Inside?

This repository provides simple and clear examples of *do*, *while*, and *for* loops in both JavaScript and PHP. These examples serve as a great starting point for beginners trying to understand the concept of loops and their syntax in these languages.

## Learning Outcomes

By exploring this repository, you will:

- Understand the syntax and usage of *do*, *while*, and *for* loops in JavaScript and PHP.
- Learn how to control the flow of your program using loops.
- Gain practical experience by seeing how these loops work in real code examples.
